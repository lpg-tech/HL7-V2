# HL7 Patientenschnittstelle V2.9

HL7 Messaging Standard Version 2.9, alias V2.9

## Managment Summary

Since the publication of the standard for version 2.4 in 2011, both the requirements for uniform content use in Switzerland and the legal requirements in the healthcare sector have changed significantly. With the introduction of the EPD, it must be possible to distribute the documentation of consent and data protection criteria across all systems in the hospital, and a revision of the "gender status" is currently necessary, even though this has not yet been required in Switzerland for data transmission in the hospital. For these reasons, this publication is based on the latest version of HL7 v2.9.1.
HL7 Switzerland is aware that the trend is clearly towards the use of FHIR and that the use of Hl7 v2 will only be applied in the medium term. However, the definition of this standard interface for Switzerland can also be used for a future mapping from v2 to FHIR. In this sense, segments are also described which may not be necessary for all applications in the hospital. According to the HL7 standard, applications are free not to use segments when sending or receiving.
